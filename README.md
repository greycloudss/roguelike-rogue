# **Roguelike Rogue**

**Roguelike Rogue** is a fast-paced 2D action platformer built in Processing. Explore dynamic environments, overcome challenges, and experience smooth character controls, including fluid jumping mechanics and responsive movement. This project is designed to be highly customizable and scalable, providing a solid foundation for developing platformer-style games with a focus on character physics and world interaction.

## **Features**
- **Smooth Jumping and Movement**: Optimized character physics for fluid vertical jumps and seamless horizontal movement.
- **Customizable World**: Easy-to-modify environment textures and mechanics.
- **State Management**: Well-organized state handling for jumping, falling, and player movement.
- **Processing Framework**: Built using Processing for quick development and visual output.

## **Installation**
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the project in the Processing IDE.
3. Run the `roguelikeRogue.pde` file to start the game.

## **Customization**
- Modify the `localPlayer.pde` file to adjust player mechanics (speed, jump height, etc.).
- Swap out textures in the `textures/` folder to customize the game world.

## **Contributing**
Feel free to fork the project, submit issues, or suggest improvements!
